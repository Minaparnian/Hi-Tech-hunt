# HI-TECH HUNT

Project Group by Mina Parnian & Miriam Espinosa

### Introduction

This is a Hi-Tech hunt app that we made for our group project, as part of our Web immersive 23 with General Assembly.


### Description

Hi-Tech hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. Itâ€™s a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.

### Features
We created a single page application using React and Firebase.
We added the feature to be able to signup with Facebook, Twitter, Google and GitHub
It is really easy to upload your product and vote for your favourite ones.
You can open the product details, and vote from there and also see the discussion and comment and if you like the product, you can re-direct to their website.
